# Trustworthy Generative AI Handbook

## Introduction: Trustworthiness in AI
Generative AI unlocks massive potential for productivity, creativity, and automation — but it also comes with pitfalls. These systems are not sources of truth; they generate plausible text, images, or code, which can include errors, biases, or harmful outputs. Trustworthy use means understanding when AI helps **augment human judgment** versus when it risks misinformation or harm.  
Core principles include:
- **Transparency & traceability**: Always be able to verify outputs against sources.  
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Keep people in charge, not replaced.  
- **Risk-awareness**: Avoid high-stakes decisions without oversight.  
- **Appropriate problem framing**: Use AI where value remains even if outputs are partial or imperfect.

## The ACHIEVE Framework
The **ACHIEVE** framework reframes AI not as "artificial intelligence" but as **augmented intelligence** — a tool that extends human abilities like an "exoskeleton for the mind." It emphasizes collaboration between humans and machines.  

**Components of ACHIEVE:**
- **A – Aiding Human Coordination**  
- **C – Cutting Out Tedious Tasks**  
- **H – Helping Provide a Safety Net**  
- **I (EV) – Inspiring Better Problem Solving & Creativity**  
- **E – Enabling Ideas to Scale Faster**  

The mindset: **AI augments human spark, not replaces it.**

## Promising Generative AI Task Types

The following sections are detailed in individual files:

- [Navigation](patterns/navigation.md) — “Take me to the truth, don’t generate it”  
- [Ideation](patterns/ideation.md) — “A creative sparring partner, not a ghostwriter”  
- [Filtering](patterns/filtering.md) — “Smaller, truer, and traceable”  
- [Expertise Support](patterns/expertise.md) — “Amplify experts; don’t replace them”

## Key Takeaways
- Generative AI is **best used where humans can easily verify, refine, or guide outputs.**  
- The **ACHIEVE framework** keeps the focus on augmentation, not automation.  
- **Navigation, Ideation, Filtering, and Expertise support** are the most promising application classes.

✅ Use this handbook as a practical compass: when designing AI applications, ask *“Does this ACHIEVE something for people, or does it risk misleading them?”*
