### Ideation — “A creative sparring partner, not a ghostwriter”
**Purpose**  
Use AI to **spark creativity**, expand the search space, and surface non-obvious options. The human remains the **author and editor**.

**Working principles**
- Generate **many** options cheaply; expect to discard most.  
- Encourage **divergent → convergent** flow (wild ideas → shortlisted candidates).  
- Use **diagrams or structured canvases** (concept maps, flow charts) to reveal relationships.

**Structured techniques**
- **Idea Burst** — produce 20–50 unconventional concepts tagged by theme and novelty.  
- **Perspective Shift** — re-generate from the view of user personas, competitors, or constraints.  
- **Constraint Flip** — intentionally reverse constraints to expose overlooked solutions.  
- **Visualize to Think** — request ASCII/mermaid drafts of architectures or flows to spot gaps.

**Example prompts**
- “Give me 25 product concepts for {target user} optimizing for {metric}; label each with risk, cost, and time-to-first-prototype.”  
- “Sketch a mermaid sequence diagram for onboarding flow A vs B; call out failure points.”

**Governance & safety**
- Clearly mark outputs as **drafts**.  
- For claims, require **citations or sources** before elevating an idea.  
- Maintain a **decision log**: what the AI suggested, what the team kept, and why.

**KPIs**
- Time-to-first-viable concept ↓, option set diversity ↑, stakeholder satisfaction with finalists ↑.
